# ðŸ“Š Slack Pulse

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Slack Pulse is a web application that lets you connect to your Slack workspace, send instant messages, and schedule messages to any of your channels.
It uses **Slack OAuth** for authentication, securely stores and manages tokens, and allows you to manage your scheduled messages in an intuitive dashboard.

## ðŸš€ 1. Setup Instructions

### **Step 1 â€“ Create a Slack App**

1. Create a Slack account and workspace if you donâ€™t already have one.
2. Go to the **Slack API Console**:
   ðŸ”— [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
3. Click **Create New App** â†’ **From Scratch** â†’ Give it a name and choose your workspace.
4. Note down your:

   * `Slack Client ID`
   * `Slack Client Secret`
5. In your appâ€™s settings, go to **OAuth & Permissions** â†’ **Redirect URLs** and add:

   ```
   https://localhost:5000/callback
   ```

   This will be used for **local development**.

---

### **Step 2 â€“ Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrApoorv/slack-pulse.git
cd slack-pulse
```

---

### **Step 3 â€“ Backend Setup (TypeScript + Express)**

1. Move into the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile TypeScript (if needed) & run:

   ```bash
   npm run build 
   npm run dev
   ```

> **Note:** The backend is already configured for TypeScript (`tsconfig.json` is included).

---

### **Step 4 â€“ Frontend Setup (Next.js + TypeScript)**

1. Move into the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

> The frontend is built with **Next.js + TypeScript** and connects to the backend for API calls.

---

### **Step 5 â€“ Enable HTTPS for Local Development (Slack Requirement)**

Slack **only allows HTTPS** for OAuth callbacks, so youâ€™ll need to enable HTTPS locally.

#### 5.1 Install Chocolatey (Windows)

Visit: [https://chocolatey.org/install](https://chocolatey.org/install)
Follow the instructions for your system.

#### 5.2 Install mkcert

```bash
choco install mkcert
```

#### 5.3 Install local CA & generate certificates

Inside your `backend` directory:

```bash
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost
```

This will generate:

```
localhost.pem
localhost-key.pem
```

You can then configure your backend server to use these for HTTPS.

---

### **Step 6 â€“ Create `.env` File in Backend**

Inside `backend/.env`:

```env
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your_id
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
SLACK_REDIRECT_URI=https://localhost:5000/callback
PORT=5000
```

---

### **Step 7 â€“ Run Both Servers**

**Backend**

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Visit:

```
https://localhost:3000
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ 2. How to Use

1. Open `https://localhost:3000` in your browser.
2. Click **"Get Started"** â†’ Youâ€™ll be redirected to Slackâ€™s OAuth screen.
3. Approve the app â†’ Youâ€™ll be redirected to the **Slack Pulse Dashboard**.
4. From here you can:

   * Select a channel
   * Send **instant messages**
   * Schedule messages for the future
5. Below, youâ€™ll see the **list of your scheduled messages**.
6. To **logout** or **switch workspaces**, click **"LOGOUT"** in the top-right corner.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed rewrite of those two sections while keeping them concise and professional.

## ðŸ›  3. Architectural Overview

### **Backend**

* Built with **TypeScript + Express** for type safety and maintainability.
* Handles the complete **Slack OAuth 2.0** authentication process, including redirect handling and token exchange.
* Securely stores **access tokens** and **refresh tokens** for each workspace. Automatically refreshes tokens when they expire.
* Includes a **scheduler service** that runs every second to check for pending scheduled messages and sends them at the right time.
* Communicates with Slackâ€™s Web API to send, schedule, and cancel messages.
* Configured to run on **HTTPS locally** using mkcert, since Slack requires a secure callback URL during OAuth.

### **Frontend**

* Built with **Next.js + TypeScript** for a fast, modern, and type-safe UI.
* Implements an **interactive dashboard** where users can:

  * View a list of their Slack channels
  * Send instant messages
  * Schedule messages for future delivery
  * View and cancel upcoming scheduled messages
* Fetches data from the backend via REST APIs (`/slack/channels`, `/slack/messages/scheduled`, etc.).
* Uses state management via React hooks to keep the UI in sync with the backend in real-time.

### **OAuth Flow**

1. The user clicks **Get Started** and is redirected to Slackâ€™s OAuth authorization page.
2. The user grants permission for the app to access their workspace.
3. Slack sends an authorization code back to the backend at the `/callback` endpoint.
4. The backend exchanges the authorization code for an **access token** and stores it securely.
5. The stored token is used for all future interactions with Slackâ€™s APIs on behalf of the user.

## 4. Challenges & Learnings

**Challenges:**

* **HTTPS requirement for Slack OAuth locally** â€“ Slack enforces HTTPS for redirect URIs, so local development was initially blocked.
  Solved by integrating **mkcert** to create a trusted local certificate for the backend server.
* **Reliable message scheduling** â€“ Slackâ€™s API doesnâ€™t natively support arbitrary scheduling from a local server, so we implemented our own **scheduler loop** that checks every second if any messages are due and sends them instantly.
* **Persistence of scheduled tasks** â€“ Without storage, scheduled messages would be lost on server restarts. We addressed this by **saving schedules in persistent backend storage** so they survive restarts and redeployments.
* **Mapping channel IDs to names** â€“ Slackâ€™s API returns scheduled messages with channel IDs only. We solved this by **fetching channel lists** on login and mapping IDs to human-readable names for display in the dashboard.

**Learnings:**

* Gained deep understanding of **OAuth token lifecycle management** â€” from acquiring tokens to refreshing them automatically before expiry.
* Learned how to integrate a real-time scheduler with an external API while ensuring **time precision** and **reliability**.
* Appreciated the importance of a **clear separation of concerns** â€” keeping authentication, token handling, scheduling, and UI rendering in distinct layers made debugging and future scaling easier.
* Strengthened knowledge of **Slackâ€™s Web API** and the practical steps needed to integrate it into a full-stack application.
